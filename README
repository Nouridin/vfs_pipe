                      VFS-PIPE
==========================================================

WHAT IS THIS?
VFS-Pipe is a lightweight C header that exposes your 
program's internal variables as real files in the Linux 
filesystem.

It creates a "live bridge" between your running C code 
and the shell. If you have a variable 'int status', it 
appears as /tmp/vfs/status.
- View real-time data: cat /tmp/vfs/status
- Update settings live: echo 1 > /tmp/vfs/status

It uses FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to run a 
background thread, allowing for zero-latency 
communication without interrupting your main logic.

WHY USE IT?
- Live Debugging: Monitor internal state without logs.
- Easy IPC: Any language (Python, Bash, Node.js) can 
  control your C app by simply reading/writing files.
- Zero Infrastructure: No sockets, no local servers, 
  and no databases required.
- High Performance: Reads/writes happen directly in 
  your program's memory.

USE CASES:
- System Daemons: Change logging levels on the fly.
- Robotics/IoT: Monitor sensor data in real-time.
- Simulation: Adjust parameters without restarting.
- Game Servers: Track player counts and server health.

HOW TO BUILD:
1. Install FUSE: sudo apt install libfuse-dev pkgconf
2. Compile: gcc main.c -o app -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -lfuse -lpthread

HOW TO USE IN CODE:
   vfs_init("/tmp/vfs");
   vfs_register_int("worker_count", &workers);
   vfs_register_str("app_status",   status_buffer);
